## Overview
Welcome to my first Frontend Mentor challenge, first of hopefully many. I am a retired technology engineer following two careers. The last time I had anything to do with Web technology was way back in 2008. Shortly after that I became briefly unemployed until I landed a position working for a DoD entity mostly doing MS Office programming with connections to an Oracle database. Three years into retirement I have decided to keep my mind sharp and my Web skills updated and maybe earn a little coin along the way. These FEM challenges are a means to that end.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

- Build until it breaks.
- Beef up on Git and Github along the way.
- Learn what broke and why.
- Research and impliment solution.
- Return to building.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive construction (hopefully)
- CSS pseudo elements
- CSS custom properites

### What I learned

In the following code I was able to use CSS to impliment a "prefered" line break so information is displayed in a better format when the narrower viewport forces a line break.

```html
    <footer>
      <div class="attribution">
        <span class="brokenLine">Challenge by
        <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io?ref=challenge" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor</a>.</span>
        <span class="brokenLine"> Coded by <a href="#">Bob Newsome</a>.</span>
      </div>
    </footer>
```
```css
span.brokenLine {
  display: inline-block;
}
```
### Continued development

A broader understanding of all the new tools available in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript since I last worked with them.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) - Great Web tech documentation along with . . .
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Nice resource with hands on examples.

## Author

- Bob Newsome . . . Nothing built worth mentioning yet.
